    <h3>The Process</h3>
        <p class="synopsis">As a Service Technician for MCC, I had to travel all around Minnesota to some 700+ locations. Even Dunbar would scoff at remembering 700 unique locations! As with all developers worth their salt, I saw a problem and I sought to solve it. With a lot of Coffee and a 30 page hard copy in hand, I set out to create an account directory application using one of the most popular JavaScript MV* frameworks, Backbone.js.</p>
        <p class="synopsis">The application is pretty simple, I made a clean underscore template which I then populated with model data, one for each of the collection of 700 account models. The directory can be filtered alphabetically using the drop-down menu. Each entry contains a name, address, optional phone number links and map link in which I cleverly URI encoded the account's name and address then appended it to the Google Maps URL. Pretty neat stuff. I learned a heck of a lot making this app, I'm darn proud of it and the guys at MCC still use it today.<a href="http://danielmoe.net/mcc">Check it out!</a></p>
