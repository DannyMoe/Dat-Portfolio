    <h3>The Process</h3>
    <p class="synopsis">I was awarded a fantastic opportunity by Amadeus Chamber Symphony when they agreed to bring me on as their Web Master. Amadeus is a 501C3 symphony operating out of St. John's University in Collegevile, MN. Being a performing organization, it was crucial that Amadeus had a website that was updated frequently, included multimedia featuring their performances and valuable organization information including a player roster, season schedule, contact info, and an audition form. There is an Amadeus member login which provides access to a member dashboard. The site is built on WordPress with some custom PHP scripts to power backend data retrieval.</p>
    <p class="synopsis">Given the incredible trend mobile traffic is taking, it was absolutely necessary to design the site as responsive and mobile-friendly. The mobile view has a much more streamlined welcome page with important performance information front-and-center. This site was a blast to create! Look out for full-scale deployment in May, 2014. <a href="http://danielmoe.net/acsdemo">Check it out!</a></p>
