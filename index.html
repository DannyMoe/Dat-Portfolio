        							Every day, across the globe increasingly more people are logging on to social platforms and blogs. Most of us can empathize with this as we are contributors to the trend. The social media trend is very real and so are the statistics coming in. There are over 1.5 Billion users online worldwide. The Nielsen group reports that three out of four users visit at least one social media outlet while online. That’s over 1 Billion social media users, 1 Billion pairs of eyes and 1 Billion marketing opportunities. 
        						</p>
        						
        						<p>
        							Social media has become a global phenomenon that is causing unpredicted global political change. These statistics indicate an equally significant impact on how marketers’ messages are going to reach their customers’ eyes going forward.

        						<p>
        							<strong>What is Social Media Marketing?</strong>
        							<br />        				
        								The “formal” definition of social media marketing (SMM) goes something like: “…centers on efforts to create content that attracts attention and encourages user to share it throughout their social network.” What this means is that a corporate message can spread from user to user while gaining an intrinsic sense of trust because the message is in the form of a customer endorsement rather than a commercial. The result is earned media rather than <em>paid</em> media.
        						</p>
        						
        						<p>
        							<strong>What Businesses Use Social Media Marketing?</strong>
        							<br />
        								There are real-world examples of businesses from Fortune 500s to non-profits effectively using social media. Still, not all business are adopting SMM with equal enthusiasm. While the majority of both B2B and B2C business have at least SOME web presence, there is not a consensus of whether or not their efforts are paying off. Over a quarter of respondents in the accompanying graphic provide the bare minimum of content and are unsure if their efforts are baring any fruit. 7% of respondents have seen “measurable” ROI and also have a “liberal” SMM budget. Perhaps the key here to an effective SMM campaign is a campaign that is rich in budget and man-hours.

        							<strong>Developing a Social Media Marketing Strategy:</strong>
        							<br />
        								Good SMM results come from a sound, well-planned strategy, not from a series of random activities. Below is a list of four steps to consider when developing a social media marketing strategy. Try thinking about how you can apply each of these to your business of choice while maintaining a message consistent with other marketing efforts.
        						</p>
        						<ol>
        							<li>
        								Listen to the Target Audience:<br />
        								It is often said that good leaders are great listeners. Good leaders and good marketers have this in common. Whether your talking about acquisition or retention, marketers must identify social habits and patterns in their audiences’ behavior.  Each audience has unique habits and favorite sites. Young men spend much of their time playing online games while young mothers have “mommy” blogs.
        							</li>
        							<li>
        								Communicate with Your Audience in a Social Space:<br /> 
        								This one might seems like a no-brainer, I mean all marketers do is communicate their message, right? Well, yes but old school print and television marketing is out the window. Both the landscape and the rules have changed in this new era of social media marketing. For example: traditional media provides marketers a one-to-many relationship with their customers. Social media (and the Internet in general) broaden that relationship into the many-to-many variety. Fun fact: humans are a social species and we look to others for reassurance. This behavior extends into buying behavior. No one wants to get ripped-off, bamboozled or flim-flammed, we look to other consumers for product endorsements. I am of the opinion that this benefits the consumer greatly. 
        								
        							</li>
        							<li>
        								Engage Your Audience:<br />
        								The process of engagement is essentially communication, turned up a notch. In the case of SMM, the communication NEEDS to be engaging and relevant or it will not sustain eyeballs and mouse-fingers. Unlike traditional media, there is a hierarchy of web content starting with consumption (the only mode in traditional marketing) through interaction and peaking at creation. In other words, users consuming your content is good, if they write a small social media post or product review/comment that’s great, if they start or propel a product dialogue that’s even better! Comments, review, contests, giveaways and fan-generated content are just some examples of engaging content. Nowadays marketers need to send their audience a call to action to get the most out of their campaigns.
        								
        							</li>
        							<li>
        								Collaborate with the Brand:<br />
        								If engagement is one step above communication then collaboration is one step above engagement. Now, I briefly mentioned that marketers need to give their audience a call to action; in this section I will expound on that statement with ideas and examples. Corporate blogs allow businesses to establish credibility, authority and hopefully trust with the consumers and B2B partners alike. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter can be used in synergy with traditional radio, TV and print advertising. Marketers could create TV campaign that presents viewers a call to action by visiting the firm’s social media outlets. On the flip-side, a firm could tweet or post about an exciting new campaign to kick-off during primetime TV.
        								
        							</li>
        						</ol>
        						<p>
        							There is an old adage in advertising that states, “Marketers must follow they eyeballs.” In other words, allow your audience to tell you where and how to market them by analyzing their habits, choice of media and activities while online. There are distinct levels of audience interaction with the content marketers create: simple consumption, engagement and collaboration to name a few. Above all else, SMM is one of many tools in marketers’ toolbox that can be used to take an established brand message to new audiences.
